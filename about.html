            <p>My name is Mona Azami, from Iran, moved to the Uk 2011. I used to work as agraphic designer for around 10 years, I was happy with that. But when I heard about coding from a friend, I thought lets just have a look at that. I had a look and still I am looking and looking at that. It is not easy to leave it. I enjoy creating something simple but handy that makes the life easier. I started with HTML5 and CSS3. And soon jumped to learn about vanilla Javascript, then tried new feutures(ES6) and also a deep undrestanding of JS. Just a quick look at database(SQL) and backend development using NodeJS.My favorite JavaScript library which is created by Facebook, is React. It's amazinly fast and efficient.Also It is easy to understand and less verbose than vanilla JS api.</p>
